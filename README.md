# CryptoRiskAssessment
Crypto Currency Risk Assessment Web Application

## Purpose / Proposed Features:
Created to facilitate the development of an online tool to help assess the risk levels assocaited with various crypto currencies.  This is a do-ocracy; feel free to submit pull requests or fork at any time.  If you get something up and running, send me that URL so I can start using your product.

This should facilitate the following:
1) Submit information for new crypto currencies
2) Prioritize information displayed by user defined trusted sources (other users)
3) Allow users to submit information on risks / mitigations and add sources of information
4) Store user public wallet addresses so others can provide tips if they find the information valuable (done outside of platform) but we should make this as easy as possible with UI.

Privacy is a concern.  We will not be storing or leveraging any data on users beyond a user pseudoname and public wallet address(es).  No email addresses, IP Addresses.  To reduce SPAM and associated expenses, we will have a SPAMMER list which will effectively mute additions from these users.
